# Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm, implemented as an iOS app in Swift.
Not the best thing ever, but this is my first Swift project.

## Some Brief Instructions
**Tap in a blank space** to create a vertex.

**Tap on a vertex** to set it as the start or end of the path.

**Tap and hold**, then drag to another vertex to form a connecting edge.
The rest should be self-explanatory.

So far, edges are weighted randomly. I'll hopefully change this at some point in the future.
